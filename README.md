# ltu-ili

The [Learning the Universe](https://www.learning-the-universe.org/) Implicit Likelihood Inference (LtU-ILI) pipeline is a framework for applying simulation-based inference methods to constrain posteriors on cosmological parameters using astronomical survey data. The code is currently built to analyze spectroscopic surveys of the universe's Large-Scale Structure (LSS), such as SDSS-BOSS.

# Contributing to LtU-ILI

This is a brief guide to contributing to the LtU-ILI code. 

## Identifying Issues
Action items and current work efforts are organized through [Github Issues](https://github.com/maho3/ltu-ili/issues). Branches and pull requests should be created and organized through public issues. For a Kanban board view of the status of current issues, there is also a [Github project page](https://github.com/users/maho3/projects/1). 

For new contributers, issues tagged with 'good first issue' are a good place to start.

## Making and submitting changes.
The first step to contributing to the repository is installing it on your machine. Follow [these instructions](INSTALL.md) for getting your environment set up.

Once the code is setup and working, you can start tackling your first issue.

## Declaring new issues.

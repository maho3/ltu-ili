# LtU ILI Software Paper Figures

This directory contains scripts and notebooks necessary for running the examples described in the software release paper ([arxiv:2402.05137](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05137)).

The examples include:
- [Figure 1](./fig1_ex/): An example of likelihood, prior, and posterior distributions for a simple model.
- [Figure 3](./fig3_toy/): A synthetic toy inference problem.
- [Figure 4](./fig4_slcp/): Benchmarking various ILI engines on the SLCP Benchmark.
- [Figure 5](./fig5_xray/): Inference of galaxy cluster masses from X-ray images.
- [Figure 6](./fig6_quijote/): Inference of cosmological parameters from dark matter power spectra.
- [Figure 7](./fig7_graph/): Inference of cosmological parameters from point cloud halo catalogs using graph embeddings.
- [Figure 8](./fig8_gw/): Inference of merger parameters from gravitational waves
- [Figure 9](./fig9_dust/): Inference of dust parameters from galaxy photomery.
- [Figure 10](./fig10_sam/): Inference of SAM parameters from galaxy properties.

Currently, the examples are not conveniently built for running out-of-the-box but are provided as reference to the configurations used for the paper. This directory will eventually be updated to include a more unified and accessible interface, as well as public data hosting.
